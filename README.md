# AI-development-project-coding-assignment
coding assignment for the AI development project:


##Initial task:
You should submit a small coding assignment in which your task is to create a small app using Flask (https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/quickstart/)
The app should have a text field and a button. When the button is pressed, the text written in the text field will be sent to the backend, which will translate it from English to Finnish, for example, using this model: https://huggingface.co/Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-fi. 
Click “Use in Transformers” to see how to load the model and refer to Pipeline documentation to use the model to translate text (https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/pipelines). NB. There is also a Pipeline for translation. 

##My external features: 
/nweb page design, 
/nloading spinner,
/ndark mode,
/nrecent translations area,
'/n'adaptive appearance and layout for mobile devices
